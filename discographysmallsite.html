        <p class="content-text">The Upsides is a part of a trilogy (along with Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing and The Greatest Generation) that dealt with vocalist Dan Campbell's struggles of being scared, loneliness and feeling lost. It's is about fighting back. Although it seemed the members of the band had been beaten into misery in their early 20s, after a month of writing with the band living in his home, they emerged with a newly adopted 'we're not sad anymore' philosophy.</p>

        <h3 class="content-title">Sister Cities (2018)</h3>
        <p class="content-text">After the release of No Closer to Heaven in 2015, The Wonder Years spent two years on a massive world tour to support the album. Along the way, Dan Campbell kept a journal to document experiences and feelings, and the band took photographs of everything they saw. Following the tour, they went through the collections and highlighted excerpts they felt were meaningful. Lyrics began to take shape, and the band worked to compose music that fit the mood of the lyrical content. Sister Cities came together from this process as "a record that seeks to create unity in a world that is becoming increasingly segregated".</p>
